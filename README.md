## Project Overview

The React eCom Store showcases various essential features of an online store, including a homepage with product listings, individual product pages, a cart page, and a checkout success page. The project utilizes the power of React and other dependencies to create a seamless user experience.

## Project Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner.
- `npm eject`: Ejects the project from Create React App configuration.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/): Enables routing and navigation within the app.
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/): Allows writing CSS within JavaScript to style components.
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/): A form validation library for React.
- [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup): A JavaScript schema builder for form validation.

## Features and Components

The React eCom Store project includes the following key features and components:

- **Homepage**: Displays a list of all products and a look-ahead search bar for filtering products by name.
- **Individual Product Page**: Provides detailed information about a single product, including the title, description, image, and reviews. Users can add the product to their cart from this page.
- **Cart Page**: Lists all the products in the cart and calculates the total. Users can proceed to checkout from this page.
- **Checkout Success Page**: Displays a confirmation message for a successful order and clears the cart. Users can return to the store from this page.
- **Header and Footer**: The layout component includes a header with a navigation bar and a cart icon component that shows the current number of items in the cart. The footer component provides additional information or links.

## Folder Structure

The project's folder structure is as follows:

- `src`: Contains the source code files.
  - `components`: Contains reusable components used throughout the app.
  - `pages`: Contains individual pages of the e-commerce store.
  - `utils`: Contains utility functions or helper modules.
  - `styles`: Contains global styles and CSS files.
  - `App.js`: The root component of the app.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of the app.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Build the application using the `npm build` command.
2. Deploy the generated `build` folder to a hosting platform like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

Ensure that the hosting platform is properly configured to serve a React application.

## Additional Information

- The project utilizes React Router for seamless navigation between pages.
- Form validation is implemented using the react-hook-form library and yup schema validation.
- The app is designed to be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes.
- The project's code follows clean and well-formatted coding practices.
